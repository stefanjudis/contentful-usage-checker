# Contentful Usage Checker - Chrome Extension

Just a tiny helper extension to help keeping track which sites use Contentful.

## How to install the extension:
1. Create a copy of the extension folder or your computer - git clone (or manually download, but breaks sync)
2. Open Chrome Extensions chrome://extensions/ > and enable "Developer mode"
3. Select "Load unpacked extensionâ€¦" > select the copied folder of extension.
4. Enjoy

## How it works:
To see if a website uses Contentful, open that website and if you see the extension icon turn full color, then it's using one of Contentful's APIs. Normally the extension icon is greyscale.
- For example, visit www.contentful.com and you should see the icon in full color.
